      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>Greetings! My name is Diego Fusaro, I'm 27 years old and I'm a Web Front-End Developer ðŸ’», I'm a graduated student from Academlo's Bootcamp and I'm excited to get my first job in tech industry.. I love to resolve problems, it makes me a better developer and agilize my logic ðŸ”§ðŸ”©, I'm very comfortable working in teams because, from my point of view, it's the best way to resolve things in a fast and efficient way and I'm versatile to new technologies too, so if I have to learn something to work in some project, I'm pleasant!! It would be so cool if you could get me a chance to show you my skills and get my first job by the hand of your company! So if you want, don't doubt and contact me! ðŸ“©</p>
